The code for this assignment is found in the pymaceuticals folder and is the Jupyter file pymaceuticals_starter.


There were a few pieces of code I needed assistance on from the Learning Assistants:
- On bar chart B, I ran into an unexpected coding issue that I attempted to work through with a learning assistant. Ended up throwing away my code and restarting with something the learning assistant provided due to neither of us being able to find the error. 
- I was assisted in identifying the duplicates, but ultimately ended up writing my own code with their support.
- On the quartiles section, I was able to recognize the need for a loop to get started, but was struggling with how to write the syntax for it. Received some starter code from a learning assistant.
-In the correlation/regression section, I was largely able to complete the tasks myself. However, I did have some issues getting the regression line to post in the final scatter plot, and used some help from a learning assistant.

There were also a few situations where I followed code off of the web:
- Finding unique values: https://www.statology.org/pandas-count-unique-values/
- Correlation: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44527956/python-ufunc-add-did-not-contain-a-loop-with-signature-matching-types-dtype


The remainder of the syntax was either self-generated, or created from adjusting syntax from in class sessions.
